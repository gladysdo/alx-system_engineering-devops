Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Incident


Duration:	
Start Time: 2024-01-21 11:00 GMT
End Time: 2024-01-21 17:30 GMT
Impact:
The API service was completely down for approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.
Users experienced a 500 Internal Server Error during the outage.
Root Cause:
The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the Apache server settings.
Timeline:
15:00 GMT: Issue Detection
The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in 500 errors.
15:15 GMT: Initial Investigation
Investigation began by checking server logs and running basic diagnostics.
Strace was utilized to trace the running processes and understand system calls.
Initial assumption was a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden increase in error rates.
16:00 GMT: Misleading Investigation Paths
Multiple failed attempts to access a specific API endpoint were observed in the logs.
Focus shifted towards a possible security breach or a vulnerability in the API code.
17:00 GMT: Escalation
The incident was escalated to the development team as the operations team could not identify the root cause.
Further investigation was conducted by the development team, analyzing the  codebase.
17:30 GMT: Issue Resolution
The root cause was identified using strace, revealing a misconfiguration in the Apache server's virtual host settings.
The misconfiguration led to incorrect routing of requests, causing the 500 errors.
The configuration was corrected, and Apache was restarted to apply the changes.
Testing was conducted to ensure the issue was fully resolved.
Root Cause Explanation:
The Apache server's virtual host settings were incorrectly configured, leading to misrouting of requests.
Resolution Details:
The misconfigured virtual host settings were corrected to properly route requests to the API service.
Apache was restarted to apply the configuration changes.
Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the issue was fully resolved.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhanced monitoring: Implementation of more granular monitoring for specific API endpoints to quickly detect similar issues.
Regular configuration audits: Schedule regular reviews of server configurations to catch potential misconfigurations early.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Immediate:
Implementation of automated tests for Apache virtual host configurations to catch errors before deployment.
Update incident response playbook to include strace for diagnosing server-related issues.
Short-term:
Conduct a comprehensive review of all server configurations to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.
Provide additional training for operations and development teams on effective incident response and debugging techniques.
Long-term:
Exploration of the possibility of implementing a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime during configuration changes.
Investigate the feasibility of incorporating automated configuration management tools beyond Puppet for better infrastructure management.
Conclusion:
The web stack outage was successfully resolved by identifying and correcting the misconfiguration in the Apache server settings. Lessons learned from this incident will be used to implement preventive measures and improve the overall robustness of the system. The incident highlights the importance of comprehensive monitoring, swift debugging techniques, and proactive configuration management.
